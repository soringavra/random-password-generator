# Random Password Generator

This Random Password Generator is a simple yet handy tool built with Next.js, perfect for quickly creating random passwords. You can customize it to your liking by choosing how long the password should be, what characters to include—letters, numbers, symbols—or even leave out certain ones you don't want.

It's super easy to use, with a clean and user-friendly design that makes password generation a breeze. Each password is made using a pseudo-random number generator, so it's great for everyday use, but maybe not the best choice for super sensitive accounts.

Whether you need a strong password or something more specific, this tool has you covered. It works smoothly on both desktop and mobile, so you can use it wherever you are.

## Features
- **Custom Length**: Set your password length, anywhere from 3 to 64 characters long.
- **Character Options**: Choose to include letters, digits and special characters. Customize by selecting exactly what to use or exclude—or use all at once.
- **Case Customization**: Easily switch between lowercase and uppercase for letters.
- **Fancy UI**: Clean and pleasing design for a smooth, hassle-free experience. Works great on both desktop and mobile devices.
